        More Than A Therapy's number one goal is to see your child, with
        developmental delays and various abilities, experience what all children
        are entitled to… enjoy a fun and active life that is filled with
        excitement, self-confidence, and love. We achieve this goal by
        specifically customizing each one-to-one physical therapy, occupational
        therapy and speech therapy session to meet each child's needs, offering
        group motor and sensory socialization classes (with initial assessments
        performed in order to best group the kids), as well as open play. More
        Than A Therapy is pleased to provide services through Early Intervention,
        insurance or private pay.
